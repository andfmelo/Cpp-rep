Project name: Book decoder
language: c++

how to use it:

1- Look for two folders inside the main folder (book decoder): bce and bcd. 
2- Inside each of these folders there is a Debug folder, open it.
3- Once inside Book decoder/bce(or bcd)/Debug type cmd on the address field.
4- On the prompt you should type 4 parameters: a b c d in this order. 
  - a. the name of the .exe file (bce or bcd)
  - b. type in the file with all characters you want to use as a encrypter.
  - c. type in the encrypted/decrypted message file that you want to convert.
  - d. Type in the output file that will be saved with the proper message (encrypted or decrypted).

An exemple of the input would be: c:\bce\debug> bce characters.txt decrypted_message.txt output_message.txt

-> the decrypted message will be saved on the output file.

Enjoy!
